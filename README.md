# Neovim Configuration (LazyVim)

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! This setup is built on top of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), providing a highly modular and customizable experience for developers.

## Features

- **Powered by LazyVim**: A pre-configured Neovim setup with sensible defaults and modular components.
- **Lazy.nvim for Plugin Management**: Efficient plugin loading with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
- **LSP Integration**: Ready-to-use configuration for Language Server Protocols.
- **Modern Development Workflow**: Supports Git, debugging, linting, and formatting.
- **Customizations**: Additional tweaks and plugins tailored for personal preferences.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Neovim (v0.8 or later) installed.

2. Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samyam412/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. Launch Neovim and install plugins:

   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   LazyVim will automatically bootstrap the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager and install all configured plugins.

4. Restart Neovim to apply the configuration.

## Requirements

- **Neovim v0.8+**
- Basic tools like `git`, `curl`, or `wget` (for plugin installation).
- Additional language-specific tools for LSP, linters, and formatters (e.g., `npm`, `pip`, `cargo`).

## Key Bindings

LazyVim comes with a thoughtfully designed keybinding scheme. Here are some highlights:

- `<leader>` is mapped to `\` by default.
- Key bindings include:
  - `\ff` - Open file search (Telescope)
  - `\fg` - Search project with grep
  - `\qq` - Quit Neovim
  - `\u` - Open LazyVim plugin manager
  - `[d` / `]d` - Navigate diagnostics
  - `gd` - Go to definition
  - `gr` - Show references

## Customization

To add your customizations:

1. Edit `lua/config` files or create additional module files as needed.
2. For Lazy.nvim plugins, update `lua/plugins/init.lua`.

## Troubleshooting

1. Run `:checkhealth` in Neovim to verify dependencies.
2. Use `\u` to manage and update plugins.
3. Check the LazyVim documentation for further guidance: [LazyVim Docs](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim#-documentation).
